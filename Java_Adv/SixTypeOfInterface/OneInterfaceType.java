// Types of Interfaces
// 1. Functional Interface / Single Abstract Method (SAM)
// 2. Normal Interface
// 3. Marker interface

//  1. Functional Interface:
// - Functional Interface is an interface that has only pure one abstract method.
// - It can have any number of static and default methods and also even public methods of java.lang.Object classes

//  2. Normal Interface:
// - Normal Interface is an interface that has two or more than two abstract method.
// - It can have any number of static and default methods and also even public methods of java.lang.Object classes

// 3. Marker Interface:
// - An interface that does not contain any methods, fields, Abstract Methods, and any Constants is Called a Marker interface.
// - Also, if an interface is empty, then it is known as Marker Interface.
// - The Serializable and the Cloneable interfaces are examples of Marker interfaces.
