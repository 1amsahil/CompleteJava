// Final classes:-
// When a class is declared as final, it cannot be extended by a subclass. This is useful for classes that are intended to be used as is and should not be modified or extended.

// class AdvCalc extends Calc 
// Final class stops the inheritance. Because of "final" with a "class" we can't use "extends" keyword.
